Java 8 was released in 2014, but it’s still one of the most popular versions of Java and is widely used by Java developers today. So if you’re still using an older version of Java, it’s not too late to catch up! Join instructor Maaike van Putten as she covers the many useful features that can change the way you write code with Java 8. She details new ways of working with date and time, touches on Base64, and goes over the new additions to the interfaces. She drills down on lambda expressions and the stream API, explains why the Optional class is not optional in Java, and finishes the course with several more Java features to know. Maaike also includes challenges and solutions, so you can test your knowledge as you advance through the course.
